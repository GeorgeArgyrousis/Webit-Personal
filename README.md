# Personal Website
Webit is my personal website. A place to display my projects and express my thoughts. George Argyrousis @ 2018 - 2019

## Assets
* Images and documents that are being used through the project

## Css
* The css files styling the three html pages currently on the website

## Illustrator 
* The illustrator files that I used in the website and want to keep as a backup

## Unused
* All the files that are not used anymore

## V<number>
* The latest version of the project is on the highest numbered branch

## Bugs
* So far the main bug of the website is that the website appears to be zoomed in when you view it on a mobile device. I have tried to change the 
meta tags, the widths from `px` to `%` but the problem percists. Kudos to the day I find the bug...
