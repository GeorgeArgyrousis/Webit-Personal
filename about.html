				<p>Hey, I'm George. I was born and raised in Greece in a small city called Trikala. After highschool I decided to move to the Netherlands to continue my studies. First stop was Maastrich and now I am living and Studying in Groningen. But this is not what you are here for...so here we go.
					I am a developer, specializing in Java 8 and JavaScript ES6. I consider myself to be a <span>T</span> shaped developer. Meaning that I am familiar with certain technologies but I narrow my field of work to a specific one in the hopes of becoming an expert. Over the years and during my studies I have experimented with multiple technologies, below are the ones that I love working with the most.</p>
				<div class="line color-background"></div>
				<div class="list">
					<p><span>Java</span> has been the first programming language that I was interested in. I have 6 years of experience with Java. During my studies I received two teaching assistant possitons for the courses of Object Oriented-Programming and Advanced Object Oriented-Programming. I have also developed my own Java Pattern called the Game State Pattern.</p>
					<p><span>JavaScript</span> After the ES6 update I got interested in JavaScript and more specifically React. Although Java has been my speciality, React felt right at home after reading Facebook's documentation. React allows for rapid development and prototyping at it’s best, while designing a solid architecture for scalable web applications.</p>
