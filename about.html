					<span class="about">17 / April</span>
				</div>
				<p>I am a builder at heart and I love developing visually stunning applications with scalable back-end functionality that impact our daily lives.  
				Programming has been my passion since childhood and as I grew older I found myself falling in love with the process even further. Acquiring new skills by trial is my preferred method for learning. 
				I consider myself to be a <span>T</span> shaped developer. Meaning that I am familiar with certain technologies but I narrow my field of work to a specific one in the hopes of becoming an expert. Over the years I have experimented with multiple technologies, these are the ones that I love working with the most.</p>
				<div class="list">
					<p><span>Java</span> has been the first programming language that I specialized in. Game development got me wildly interested in programming while YouTube was my learning environment. Since then, I have focused mainly on developing desktop applications using Java 8. But I have also tried to expand my java expertise to web development. Spring MVC in conjunction with Hibernate are my preferred framework and database conbination for developing web based applications. JUnit is my testing framework of choice, while my container configuration mostly includes Tomcat.</p>

					<p><span>Python</span> has been one of the most powerful languages that is easy to use and understand that I incidentally learned. Although Java has been my speciality, Python felt right at home after spending time developing. My passion for web based applications shifted my focus to the Python framework called Django. Django allows for rapid development and prototyping at it’s best while designing a solid architecture for scalable web applications.</p>
